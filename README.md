# Learning Points
There were 2 main takeaways from this project:

1. Factory Functions
2. Module Patterns

I learnt how to use factory functions as an alternative to object constructors, which can be useful as it allows us to export specific methods or properties to be "inherited" by another object. In addition, the module pattern comes in handy as well as it immediately invokes the factory function, causing it to be an instance of itself. The experience building this application was unlike the rest, as I was bogged down by other commitments, and hence a lot of the learning experience was diluted over several days.

# Contribute
Please feel free to make any suggestions, edits or raise issues. Forks and pull requests are always welcome. I am not likely to maintain the code from here on as I have to move on to other projects.

## Adding new features or fixing bugs
As mentioned above, I am not likely to maintain the code and as such, if you would like to build on this project, you could always fork or clone this repository.

# Feedback
As this was done within a month of learning Javascript, the code is written in a very amateurish manner. Criticism is always appreciated with regard to how I can better write or refactor my code.
